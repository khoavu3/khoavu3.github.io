### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because working with another person was an
    interesting part of the class that I was curious of how I would turn
    out. I initially thought pair programming was going to be bad, but having
    a partner to point out small mistakes certainly helps. In this lab, I
    changed temperature from fahrenheit to celsius which was simple to do
    but very fun since it was my first coding project.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite because I did not know how Blackjack worked,
    but the lab showed me how it worked. I was able to create if statements
    for certain cards that had a value tied to them. The overall function
    was used to decide if a hand was a bust or not.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because I was curious about how color
    worked in coding. It was really interesting pulling images from
    another file. I was able to create a function that produced a
    gradient image with certain color values.
